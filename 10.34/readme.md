I made this for 10.34. I drop it here in case someone finds it useful. 

Just FYI, it's 3/4ths made by AI and could be incomplete and wrong (haven't really had time to check it thoroughly), but it has the most important concepts and formulas according to me (and Perplexity) so I avoid going through 35 different presentations looking for a formula during the exam. 

If you find a mistake let me know, but I hope some of you find it a bit useful at least
