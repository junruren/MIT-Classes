\subsection{Capital Structure}
Structure of investors' claims to the firm's assets and future cashflows.

\Red{Modigliani-Miller Theorem} Capital structure is irrelevant to the firm's value. The
theorem requires strong assumptions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item No taxes
    \item No transaction costs or bankruptcy (or financial distress) costs
    \item Markets are efficient (rational investors, no information asymmetries)
    \item Markets are complete (for any risk, can buy/sell a contract on it)
    \item Investment decisions are fixed (regardless of choice of financing)
\end{itemize}
Under M\&M
\begin{itemize}
    \item \Blue{Market value of the firm} is unaffected by cap struct, so \fbox{$E = A - D$}
    \item \Blue{Discount rate of the firm (\ie ``risk of the firm's assets'')} weighted average of the discount rates of debt and equity:
    \fbox{$r_A = r_D \frac{D}{D + E} + r_E \frac{E}{D + E}$} where \begin{itemize}
        \item \Green{$D$} market value of debt (\$); \Green{$E = A - D$} MV of equity (\$)
        \item \Green{$r_D$} cost of debt
        \item \Green{$r_E$} cost of equity
    \end{itemize}
    \item \Blue{M\&M Proposition 2} \Hint{Higher the leverage, risker equity becomes.}
    $r_E = r_A + \frac{D}{A-D}(r_A - r_D)$
\end{itemize}

\Red{Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)} weighted avg of the costs of debt and equity \Hint{after taking into account the tax shield benefit of debt}:
\fbox{$r_{\text{WACC}} = (1- \tau) r_D \frac{D}{D+E} + r_E \frac{E}{D+E}$} where $\tau$ is marginal corporate tax rate.

\Blue{Valuation using WACC}
\fbox{$V_0 = \sum_{t=1}^{\infty} \frac{CF_t}{(1 + r_{\text{WACC}})^t}$}
where \Green{$CF_t$} cashflows using standard formula assuming no tax shield benefit od debt.

\Red{Leverage costs} more leverage has costs becayse of the potential for financial distress and/or bankruptcy, which increase the cost of borrowing.

\Red{Optimal capital structure} in theory, when WACC is minimized and firm value is maximized.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Initially, the value of the firm increases in leverage, as interest pymts are tax deductible and there's little likelihood of experiencing financial distress costs.
    \item As leverage increases, the risk of the firm increases and distress costs becomes large.
    \item At the firm's optimal lverage ratio, the gain from tax shield is just offset by the cost of distress, \Hint{maximizing the value of the levered firm $V_L$}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Financing a Startup}

\Red{Venture Capital (VC)} provides funds to build companies from the earliest stages to freestanding, mature orgs; provides managerial advice.

\Blue{Limited Partners (LPs)} institutional/high net-worth investors providing \textit{capital} to VC funds, not involving in the fund management.

\Blue{General Partners (GPs)} pick and manage the investments within the fund, earn fees and percentage of profits. Liable for the fund's actions.

\Red{Term sheet} outline of terms and conditions in VC investment. Common features:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \Blue{Staged commitment of captal} capital provided in multiple rounds.
    \item \Blue{Pre-money/post-money valuation} before/after a round of funding. \Ie \fbox{Post-money val = Pre-money val + Paid-in capital}
    \item \Blue{Convertible security} resembles a debt instrument that can be converted into common stock at a pre-specified rate.
    \item \Blue{Convenants} contract provisions to establish governance of firms. \begin{itemize}
        \item Financial: failure to meet financial targets can affect conversion ratio of stock and preferred voting rights.
        \item Negative: restriction on indebtedness or new securities issuance; purchase of assets is subject to investor approval.
        \item Affirmative: property rights provisions and patents; disclosure rights, etc.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \Blue{Registration rights} define exit options for VC and entrepreneur. \begin{itemize}
        \item Redemption: investors can sell stock back to firm at par price plus dividend.
        \item Piggy-back registration: investors can register their unregistered stock when either the company or another investor initiates a registration (\eg, during IPO process). Allows investors (including founders and VCs) to sell a large stake at IPO.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \Blue{Preferred stock shares} have \textit{liquidation preference} over common stock shares and have a FV with \textit{redemption rights}.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Relative valuation}

\Red{Equity multiples} scale the value of equity by a measure of earnings after interest pymts are made. \Eg P/E ratio $= \frac{\text{Stock price}}{EPS}$

\Red{Forward-looking P/E multiples}
\fbox{$\frac{P_0}{EPS_1} = \frac{p}{r-g}$} implied by Gordon growth model where $p$ is plowback ratio.

\subsection{Diversification}

\subsubsection{Asset return characteristics}

Buy an asset (\eg a stock) at $t = 0$ at price $P_0$. At time $t = 1$,
\begin{itemize}
    \item its cash flow (dividend) is $D_1$, and
    \item its price is $P_1$
\end{itemize}
(both are random variables). The risk-free rate is $r_F$.

\Blue{Realized return}
\fbox{$r_1 = \frac{D_1 + P_1}{P_0} - 1$}
Returns comes from both dividends and capital gains.

\Blue{Expected return}
\fbox{$E[r_1] = \frac{E[D_1] + E[P_1]}{P_0} - 1$}

\Blue{Excess return} (realized)
\fbox{$r_1 - r_F$}

\Blue{Risk premium} (expected excess return) \fbox{$E[r_1] - r_F$}

\Red{Mean (average) return}
\fbox{$\bar{r} = E[r] = \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^T r_t$}
Would be same as the expected return $E[r_t]$ if expected returns are constant for all $t$.

\Blue{Estimate Expected Return}
\begin{itemize}
    \item if have multiple possible scenarios for returns and know the probability of each scenario, use:
    \fbox{$E[r] = \sum_{i=1}^N p_i r_i$}
    \item if have a time series of past $T$ observations of returns, estimate sample estimate of expected return $\bar{r}$ as:
    \fbox{$\hat{r} = \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^T r_t$}
\end{itemize}

\Red{Variance} measures the volatility or deviation of returns from the mean.
\fbox{$\text{Var}(r) = \sigma^2 = E\left[(r - E[r])^2\right]$}
If given (past) data sample of $T$ returns, the sample variance is:
\fbox{$\hat{\sigma}^2 = \frac{1}{T-1} \sum_{t=1}^T (r_t - \bar{r})^2$}
where the expected return $\bar{r}$ can be estimated by the sample mean $\bar{r}$ as defined above.

\Red{Standard deviation} \fbox{$\sigma = \sqrt{\text{Var}(r)}$} measures the risk of the asset. Gives a magnitude in percent.

\Red{Covariance} measures the degree to which two random variables move together.
\fbox{$\sigma_{ij} = \text{Cov}(r_i, r_j) = E[(r_i - \bar{r_i})(r_j - \bar{r_j})]$}

\Blue{Estimate Cov} given (past) data sample of $T$ returns, the sample covariance is:
\fbox{$\hat{\sigma}_{ij} = \frac{1}{T-1} \sum_{t=1}^T (r_{i,t} - \bar{r_i})(r_{j,t} - \bar{r_j})$}

Covariance can be:
\begin{itemize}
    \item positive (\Hint{both variables move in the same direction}),
    \item negative (\Hint{two variables move in the opposite direction}), or
    \item zero (no relationship).
\end{itemize}
\Hint{Variance is a special case of covariance, where the two variables are the same.}
\fbox{$\text{Var}(r_i) = \sigma_{ii} = \text{Cov}(r_i, r_i)$}

\Red{Correlation} measures the strength of the linear relationship between two random variables.
\Hint{Always between -1 and 1.}
\fbox{$\text{Corr}(r_i, r_j) = \rho_{ij} = \frac{\text{Cov}(r_i, r_j)}{\sigma_i \sigma_j}$}

\Red{Beta} measures the sensitivity of an asset's return to the return of the market portfolio.
\fbox{$\beta_i = \frac{\text{Cov}(r_i, r_m)}{\text{Var}(r_m)}$}
where $r_m$ is the return of the market portfolio.

Other measures of risk:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \Blue{Skewness} captures the asymmetry of the distribution of returns.
    \item \Blue{Kurtosis} captures the "tailedness" of the distribution of returns. Higher kurtosis means more extreme values (outliers) in the distribution. \ie the distribution has ``fat tails''.
\end{itemize}

\Red{Mean-variance investors} care about the expected return (higher is better) and variance (lower is better) of the return. They are risk-averse with a risk-aversion coefficient of $A$.
\Blue{Mean-variance utility function} captures the preferences of mean-variance investors
\fbox{${U(r) = E[r] - \frac{1}{2} A \cdot \text{Var}(r)}$} where $U(r)$ is the utility of the return $r$.

\Blue{Indifference curve} is a curve that represents all combinations of expected return and variance that give the same utility to the investor. The slope of the indifference curve is given by:
\fbox{$\frac{dE[r]}{d\sigma^2} = -A$}
The slope is negative, meaning that as variance increases, the expected return must also increase to maintain the same utility.

\subsubsection{Portfolio}

\Red{Portfolio} a combination of different assets or securities. Defined by number $N_i$ and the price $P_i$ of each asset $i$ in the portfolio. The total value of the portfolio is:
\fbox{$V = \sum_{i=1}^n N_i P_i$}

\Blue{Portfolio weight} of asset $i$ in the portfolio is:
\fbox{$w_i = \frac{N_i P_i}{V}$}
The portfolio weight represents the proportion of the total portfolio value that is invested in asset $i$.
Weights can be \Hint{positive (long position)} or \Hint{negative (short position)}. $\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i = 1$

\Red{Mean and variance of a portfolio} with weights: $w_1, \dots, w_n$ and returns $r_1, \dots, r_n$:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \Blue{Random variable} $R_p = \sum_{i=1}^n w_i r_i$
    \item \Blue{Expected return}
    \fbox{$E[R_p] = \sum_{i=1}^N w_i E[r_i]$}
    \item \Blue{Variance}
    \fbox{$\text{Var}(R_p) = \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n w_i w_j \text{Cov}(r_i, r_j)$}
\end{itemize}
\Green{Special case - two assets}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $E[R_p] = w_1 E[r_1] + w_2 E[r_2]$
    \item $\text{Var}(R_p) = w_1^2 \text{Var}(r_1) + w_2^2 \text{Var}(r_2) + 2 w_1 w_2 \text{Cov}(r_1, r_2)$ (\Hint{Note: $w_2 = 1 - w_1$})
\end{itemize}

\Green{Special case - $n$ equally-weighted assets} with returns $r_1, \dots, r_n$:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $E[R_p] = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n E[r_i]$
    \item $\text{Var}(R_p) = \frac{1}{n^2} \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n \text{Cov}(r_i, r_j)$
\end{itemize}

\Blue{Portfolio beta} is the sensitivity of the portfolio return to the return of the market portfolio.

\Red{Efficient frontier and the tangency portfolio}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \Blue{Mean-variance frontier portfolio} minimizes risk (measured by variance) for a given expected return.
    \item \Blue{Efficient frontier} is the set of portfolios that offer the highest expected return for a given level of risk. (Upper part of the mean-variance frontier)
    \item \Blue{Sharpe ratio}
    \fbox{$= \frac{E[R_p] - r_f}{\sigma_p}$}
    is the slope of the line from the risk-free rate to the portfolio. It measures the risk-adjusted return of the portfolio.
    \item \Blue{Capital Market Line} represents the risk-return trade-off of efficient portfolios. It starts at the risk-free rate and is tangent to the efficient frontier. The slope of the CML is equal to the Sharpe ratio of the tangency portfolio.
\end{itemize}

\Green{\Eg \underline{False} statement} \textit{The S\&P 500 index is less volatile than an individual stock but still quite volatile. This is because the S\&P includes only 500 stocks and is missing thousands of others. An equity portfolio that diversified across all possible stocks would have close to zero risk.}
\Hint{Stocks contain some degree of systematic risk that cannot be diversified away no matter how many stocks are in the portfolio, and the market portfolio (which holds everything) is far from risk-free.}

\subsection{Risk and Return}

\Red{Basic Principles}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Investors prefer higher expected returns and lower risk
    \item \Blue{Idiosyncratic (diversifiable)} risks specific to that asset; can be eliminated through proper diversification.
    \item \Blue{Systematic (non-diversifiable)} risks inherent in the entire market; cannot be diversified away.
\end{itemize}

\Red{Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)} describes the relationship between risk and expected return. It states that the expected return of an asset is equal to the risk-free rate plus a risk premium that is proportional to the asset's beta.

\Blue{CAPM implications}
\begin{itemize}
    \item investors are \Hint{only compensated for exposure to systematic risk}.
    \item we can measure systematic risk using $\beta$.
    \item \Blue{Alpha $\alpha$} (intercept in the regression equation used to estimate $\beta$) \Hint{should be zero} because $\beta$ alone should explain all differences in expected returns among assets.
\end{itemize}

\Blue{CAPM assumptions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item No asymmetric information (everyone has the same information), and everyone agrees on the distribution of all assets' returns.
    \item Investors are rational and risk-averse.
    \item There exists a risk-free asset for both borrowing and investing.
\end{itemize}

\Red{Estimate $\beta$} as the slope coefficient when running this regression equation:
\fbox{$r_{it} - r_{ft} = \alpha_i + \beta_i (r_{mt} - r_{ft}) + \epsilon_{it}$}
We can use $\beta_i$ to calculate the expected return of stock $i$ implied by the CAPM:
\fbox{$E(r_i) = r_f + \beta_i (r_M - r_f)$} where
\begin{itemize}
    \item $r_f$ is the risk-free rate
    \item $r_M$ (also denoted $\bar{r}_M$) is the \textbf{expected return} on the market (here, $r_M = E[r_m]$)
    \item $(\bar{r}_M - r_f)$ is the \textbf{expected excess return}, aka \textbf{``market risk premium''}.
\end{itemize}

\Blue{Market portfolio} According to the CAPM, since all investors hold risky assets in the same proportions, the tangency portfolio is the market portfolio -- a value weighted index of all investors' risky positions (\ie it excludes risk-free borrowing/lending). \Hint{Market portfolio's $\beta = 1$}.

\Blue{Risk-free portfolio} Since the risk-free asset has no risk, it cannot remove any other assets. Therefore:
\fbox{$\beta_f = 0 \Rightarrow \bar{r}_f = r_f = 0 (\bar{r}_m - r_f)$}

\Blue{CAPM formula for a portfolio of assets}
\fbox{$E[R_p] = R_f + \beta_p \cdot (E[R_m] - R_f)$}
The beta of a portfolio of assets is equal to the weighted average of its constituents' $\beta$'s:
$\beta_p = w_1 \beta_1 + \dots w_n \beta_n$.

\Blue{Unlevering Betas} a special case of the formula for the beta of portfolio is frequently used to get estimates of the cost of capital for an entire firm, whose assets can be viewed as a portfolio of debt and equity.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Usually estimate firm-level \underline{equity betas} ($\beta_E$) using the stock returns of the firm.
    \item Recover \underline{asset betas} ($\beta_A$, aka \underline{unlevered betas} $\beta_U$) using the following formula:
        \fbox{$\beta_U = \beta_A = \frac{D}{D+E} \beta_D + \frac{E}{D+E} \beta_E$}
    \item Investment-grade debt (rated > BBB): assume \Hint{$\beta_D = 0$, cost of debt = risk-free rate}.
\end{itemize}

\Red{Security Market Line (SML)} CAPM's graphical representation. Plots returns (Y) on $\beta$ (X).
\Hint{If CAPM holds, all assets should lie on the SML.}

\subsection{Options}

\Red{Options}
Derivative contracts specifying \textbf{a right} to \textbf{buy (call option)} or \textbf{sell (put option)} an underlying asset at a specified price $K$ (the \textbf{strike/exercise price}) on or before a specified date $T$ (the \textbf{expiration/maturity date}).

\begin{itemize}
    \item \Blue{Call option}: right to buy the underlying asset at the strike price.
    \item \Blue{Put option}: right to sell the underlying asset at the strike price.
\end{itemize}

Exercise style:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \Blue{American option}: can be exercised at any time before expiration.
    \item \Blue{European option}: can only be exercised at expiration.
\end{itemize}

Given their identical payoffs, under no-arbitrage, they should have the same price:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $P_{call} + P_{bond} = P_{put} + P_{asset}$
    \item $C + K(1+r)^{-T} = P + S$
\end{itemize}

\Red{Binomial option pricing model} Iterative approach to price options that makes the following simplifications:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Discrete periods, in which stock price can either go up or down.
    \item We find the option price by a \textit{no arbitrage} argument. Price is equal to the cost of purchasing a \textit{replicating portfolio} whose payoffs match the option payoff in each state. \Eg, for a call, we solve: $\begin{cases}
        a S_u + b B_u &= C_u \\
        a S_d + b B_d &= C_d
    \end{cases}$ where $a$ is the number of shares of stock, $b$ is the number of bonds, $S_u$ and $S_d$ are the stock prices if it goes up or down, and $C_u$ and $C_d$ are the call option prices if stock goes up or down.
    \item  Under the binomial assumptions, \Hint{the probability of a stock moves up or down is irrelevant}, and the price of options can be determined solely using: \begin{itemize}
        \item Current stock price $S_0$, interest rate $r$, strike price $K$ and time to maturity $T$;
        \item Magnitude of possible future changes of stock price (volatility), captured implicitly by the possible values the stock can take $S_u$ and $S_d$.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\Red{Black-Scholes formula} Taking the limit of binomial model as the number of periods gets large, we obtain the B-S formula for the price of a European call option without dividends:
\fbox{$C(S, K, T, r, \sigma) = S \cdot N(x) - K(1 + r)^{-T} \cdot N(x - \sigma \sqrt{T})$}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \Blue{$S$} current value of the underlying asset (in \$)
    \item \Blue{$K$} strike price of the option (in \$)
    \item \Blue{$T$} option maturity (in years)
    \item \Blue{$r$} annual risk-free interest rate
    \item \Blue{$\sigma$} annualized standard deviation of the underlying asset's return (volatility)
    \item \Blue{$N(\cdot)$} cumulative normal distribution function (\texttt{NORM.S.DIST(x, TRUE)}). These $N(\cdot)$ terms \Hint{capture the replicating portfolio weights}.
    \item \Blue{$x$} \fbox{$x = \frac{\ln\left(\frac{S}{K(1+r)^{-T}}\right)}{\sigma \sqrt{T}} + \frac{1}{2} \sigma \sqrt{T}$}
\end{itemize}

\Green{\Eg \underline{True} statement} \textit{According to the Black-Scholes model, holding all else equal, an increase in the expected idiosyncratic volatility of Apple's stock return will increase the value of a call option on Apple stock.} \Hint{The B\&S formula considers the volatility of the underlying
asset's price, which includes idiosyncratic volatility. The value of a call option increases with volatility because it increases the possible upside for the option holder without affecting the downside, which is limited by design.}

    \Hint{The forward contract yields a higher net payoff as it has no upfront premium, unlike the put option. The put's premium, paid for potential upside if prices exceed \$6, results in a lower net payoff if prices remain below \$6 and this upside is not realized.}
