\Blue{Present Value (PV)} \fbox{$PV(CF_t) = \frac{\colorbox{PineGreen!30}{$CF_t$}}{(1+\colorbox{Blue!30}{$r$})^{\colorbox{BrickRed!30}{$t$}}}$}
how much a cash flow (CF) at time $t$ is worth at time 0 (today). Computing a PV is often called \Hint{``discounting''}.

    \item \underline{APR} $= r \cdot k$
    \item \underline{EAR} \ie Annual Percentage Yield (APY)
\end{itemize}
\Hint{If $APR = EAR$ between two savings accounts, APR (the one with more frequent compounding) is better.}

\subsubsection{Mortgage-related terms}

\Blue{Principal} the amount of \$ \underline{borrowed} in a lending agreement.
\Eg Buy a \$1,000,000 house with a 20\% down payment, the principal is \$800,000.

\Blue{Interest}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \Green{Fixed rate} No matter what happens to interest rates around the world, you would still be charged
        interest at this same rate.
    \item \Green{Adjustable rate (ARM)} \Eg an adjustable rate of 3\% \underline{above} the federal funds rate (the
        Fed's benchmark rate). If this rate is around 4.5\%, you would be charged a 7.5\% interest rate. If in the next
        month the Fed raises to 5\%, you would be charged an 8\% interest rate.
\end{itemize}

\Blue{Amortization schedule} sequence of payments made through the loan's lifetime. A part of the payments goes to
reduce (\ie amortize) the principal owed, and the rest goes to pay the interest on the loan.

\Blue{Collateral} An asset offered by the borrower as a guarantee in a loan. If you fail to make payments, the bank can
take the collateral.

\Blue{Refinancing} Paying off an existing loan with a new loan that has better terms. \Eg lower interest rate, lower
monthly payment, shorter loan term.

\Green{\Eg} a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, APR 9\% compounded monthly. Fixed monthly payment $= \$3000$. First payment
will start next month and last until the contract expires in 30 years.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \Green{How much borrowed when took out the mortgage?}
        use the constant annuity formula, where
        \Hint{$A = \mathdollar 3000$, $r = \frac{0.09}{12} = 0.0075$, $T = 30 \times 12 = 360$}.
        $PV = \frac{A}{r} \left(1 - \frac{1}{(1+r)^T}\right) = \frac{3000}{0.0075} \left(1 - \frac{1}{(1+0.0075)^{360}}\right) = \mathdollar 372,845.60$
    \item \Green{10 years later, how much must pay back to the bank if sell the house?}
        (\ie NPV of the remaining principal amount as of this future date.)
        \Hint{$T = 20 \times 12 = 240$}
        $PV = \frac{3000}{0.0075} \left(1 - \frac{1}{(1+0.0075)^{240}}\right) = \mathdollar 333,434.86$
    \item \Green{Why the remaining principal is still so high after 10 years' worth of repayments?}
        \Hint{Because the amortization schedule is front-loaded.} \Ie Early on in the life of the mortgage, the vast majority
        of each monthly payment is interest: interest is applied to the remaining principal amount, and this remaining
        principal is highest in month 1 and decreases over time. Because the majority of each monthly payment in the
        early years is interest, the principal repayment amounts are small, and the remaining principal de-creases very
        slowly. (It's only toward the end of the mortgage that interest payments decline enough to repay the principal
        more quickly.)
\end{itemize}

\Blue{Treat inflation consistently for NPV}

\fbox{$PV(CF_T) = \frac{CF_{\text{nominal,T}}}{(1 + r_{\text{nominal,T}})^T} = \frac{CF_{\text{real,T}}}{(1+r_{\text{real,T}})^T}$}
(``$_{,T}$'' denotes the cash flow at time $T$)

\textit{If inflation is zero, two projects paying \$100 in different years have the same NPV.}

\end{itemize}

\Blue{Depreciation} \underline{non-cash} expense that reduces the value of an asset over time. \Hint{For most finance
problems, we want to strip out effects of depreciation to get back to free cash flow.} Exception: if depreciation
affects free cash flows through taxes.

Determine some fixed $IRR^*$ \ie ``threshold rate'':
\begin{itemize}
    \item \Green{Independent} take if $IRR > IRR^*$.
    \item \Green{Mutually exclusive} take the one with the highest $IRR$ among projects $IRR > IRR^*$.
\end{itemize}
IRR leads to the same decision as NPV if:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Cash outflow occurs only at time 0
    \item Only one project is being considered
    \item Opportunity cost of capital (discount rate $r$) remains constant for all periods
    \item $IRR^* = r$
\end{itemize}

\Hint{Shortcomings}: no solution, multiple solutions, project size not accounted for, different projects' horizons
not fully considered.

\Green{\Eg \underline{False} statement}
\textit{If project A's NPV is larger than project B's, then the IRR of investing in project A is always higher than that
of project B.}
\Hint{The IRR could yield incongruent predictions in capital budgeting compared to the NPV rule.}

\Red{Discounted payback period} ditto but discount CFs.
\fbox{$\sum_{t=1}^{k} \frac{CF_t}{(1+IRR)^t} \ge - CF_0 = I_0$}

\Red{Profitability index (PI)} ratio of the NPV of future CFs to the initial investment.
\fbox{$PI = \frac{NPV}{I_0}$}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \Green{Independent} take all $PI > 1$.
    \item \Green{Mutually exclusive} take the one with the highest $PI$ and $PI > 1$.

\Hint{Shortcomings}: doesn't account for project size.

\subsection{Bonds}

\Red{Face value \ie ``par value'' / ``principal''} the value of a bond that appears on its face and that will be paid to the investor by the issuer at
maturity.

\Red{Coupon} interest paid on a bond's face value on a periodic basis prior to maturity.

\Red{Spot interest rate $r_t$} the market interest rate for discounting a signle risk-free cash flow
\underline{at horizon $t$}.

\Blue{Zero coupon bond} a bond that pays no coupons and is sold at a discount to its face value.

Price of a coupon bond is
\fbox{$P = \left(\sum_{t=1}^{T} \frac{C_t}{(1+r_t)^t}\right) + \frac{F}{(1+r_T)^T} = \left(\sum_{t=1}^{T} C_t \cdot P_t^{\text{ZC}}\right) + F \cdot P_T^{\text{ZC}}$}.

\Red{Yield to maturity (YTM)} the discount rate $y$ that makes the PV of a bond's future cash flows equal to its price.
\fbox{$P = \left(\sum_{t=1}^{T} \frac{C_t}{(1+y)^t}\right) + \frac{F}{(1+y)^T}$} For ZC bonds, the YTM is equal to the spot interest rate \fbox{$y = r_T$}.

\Green{\Eg Bond Arbitrage} construct a trading strategy based on a mixture of bonds to generate an arbitrage profit.

            Maturity & Spot Rate \\
            \hline
            1 & $\frac{1}{0.8} - 1 = 0.25$ \\
            2 & $\left(\frac{105}{100}\right)^{\frac{1}{2}} - 1 \approx 0.0247$ \\
            \hline
        \end{tabular}
    \item Calculate the no-arbitrage price of the coupon bond using spot rates:
        $P = \frac{5}{(1+0.25)} + \frac{105}{(1+0.0247)^2} \approx 103.999$
        which is less than the market price of \$106.
    \item \Hint{Intuition: The coupon bond is \underline{overpriced}, so sell it and buy the ZC bonds.}
    \item Goal: Use ZC bonds to replicate the coupon bond's \underline{future} cash flows.

            1 & 5\% bond & 5 & 105 \\
            \hline
        \end{tabular}
    \item Solve for $x$ and $y$:
        $\begin{cases}
            1 x + 0 y &= 5 \\
            0 x + 105 y &= 105
        \end{cases} \Rightarrow \begin{cases}
            x = 5 \\
            y = 1
        \end{cases}$
    \item At $t = 0$, buy 5 1-year ZC bonds and 1 2-year ZC bond (costs $5 \times \mathdollar 0.8 + 1 \times \mathdollar 100 = 104$)
        and sell 1 coupon bond (earning \$106). This generates \$2 arbitrage profit.
\end{enumerate}

\Red{Expectations hypothesis (EH)} the yield curve reflects the market's expectations of future interest rates.
\Ie Long-term interest rates are equal to the \underline{geometric average} of short-term interest rates until maturity.

\Green{\Eg bond risks} interest rate changes, inflation, credit/default

\subsubsection{Duration}

\Red{(Macaulay) Duration} the weighted average time to receive the bond's cash flows.
Tells how long you have to wait to receive the average dollar from owning that bond in PV-weighted terms.
\fbox{$D = \frac{1}{P} \sum_{t=1}^{T} t \cdot PV(CF_t) = \frac{1}{P} \sum_{t=1}^{T} t \cdot \frac{CF_t}{(1+y)^t}$}
\Hint{Zero-coupon bonds' duration is equal to their maturity.}
All else equal, \Hint{coupon bond has shorter duration than zero-coupon bond; higher coupon means lower duration}.

\Red{Modified duration}
\fbox{$MD = \frac{D}{(1+y)}$} the sensitivity of a bond's price to changes in interest rates.

\Blue{Price change estimate} accurate for small changes in $y$ \fbox{$\frac{\Delta P}{P} \approx -MD \times \Delta y$}
which shows that \Hint{duration measures bond exposure to interest-rate risk}.
The higher the (modified) duration of a bond, the more its price moves ($\Delta P$) given a small change in interest
rates ($\Delta y$).
\Hint{Longer duration $\Rightarrow$ more sensitive to interest rate changes.}

\Red{Duration matching (\ie immunization)} matching the duration of assets and liabilities to eliminate interest rate risk.
\fbox{$\frac{D^{\text{Assets}}\cdot \Delta y}{1 + y} P^{\text{Assets}} \approx \frac{D^{\text{Liab.}}\cdot \Delta y}{1 + y} P^{\text{Liab.}}$}
If the value of assets ($P^A$) equal to value of liabilities ($P^L$) (usually the case), then \Hint{matching durations of two immunizes
portfolio from interest-rate risk}.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \fbox{If $P^A \neq P^L$, we need to set $D^A P^A = D^L P^L$} to immunize.
    \item Value of portfolio unchanged for small movements in $y \Rightarrow$ hedged against interest-rate risk.
    \item $D^A > D^L$ bets rates will stay constant or decrease
    \item $D^A < D^L$ bets rates will increase.
    \item This is only a \Hint{local} approximation. If interest rates change, need to \Hint{rebalance} the portfolio.
\end{itemize}

\Green{\Eg \underline{False} statement}
\textit{You're uncertain about future interest rates, but your expectation is that they will stay unchanged relative to
today. It's therefore risk-free to issue short-term bonds and invest the proceeds in long-term bonds with higher yields,
and no bank that follows this strategy will ever go bankrupt.}
\Hint{\textbf{Think SVB.} If the duration of assets exceeds the duration of liabilities, then the bank is exposed to
interest-rate risk. If interest rates increase, then the value of assets will decrease more than the value of
liabilities, and the bank may not be able to repay its short-term debt.}

\Red{Default risk} a debt issuer fails to make interest or principal payments when due.
Consider a ZCB. Let $q$ be the probability of the bond pays the promised payoff (\ie $(1-q)$ it defaults), the price of
this bond:

    \item \Hint{If $ROE > r$}, reinvesting more increases shareholder value. \Hint{Optimal to reinvest} \ie investment
        opportunities that earn expected returns higher than the cost of capital. More common early in the life cycle of
        the firm.
    \item \Hint{If $ROE < r$}, reinvesting more destroys shareholder value. \Hint{Optimal not to reinvest} \ie return
        excess cash to shareholders. More common later in the life cycle of the firm where higher growth can be costly.
\end{itemize}

\Hint{If stock's growth pattern is forecasted to change over time, typically compute early-stage PV explicitly and then terminal value.}

\Red{Forcasting dividends $D_t$} firm investment determines dividend growth. Always a trade-off between (1) growning the
firm and (2) paying out dividends.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \Blue{Earnings Per Share (EPS)} net profit after taxes \fbox{$EPS = BV \times ROE$}
    \item \Blue{Dividend Payout Ratio} \fbox{$p = \frac{\text{Dividends}}{\text{Net Income}} = 1 - b$}
    \item \Blue{Retained earnings} \fbox{$\text{Net Income} - \text{Dividends}$}
    \item \Blue{Plowback Ratio} \fbox{$b = \frac{\text{Retained Earnings}}{\text{Net Income}}$}
    \item \Blue{Book value of Equity} cumulative retained earnings \fbox{$\text{BV} = \text{Assets} - \text{Liabilities}$}
    \item \Blue{Return on Equity (ROE)} how efficiently firm uses equity to generate profits \fbox{$\frac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{BV}}$}
    \item \Blue{Dividend growth rate} BV grows from R.E. If $ROE$ and $b$ are constant, $g$ is constant.
        \fbox{$g = b \cdot ROE = \frac{\Delta BV}{BV} = \frac{\text{Retained Earnings}}{\text{Net Income}} \times \frac{\text{Net Income}}{BV}$}.
    \item \Blue{Change in book value} \fbox{$\Delta \text{BV} = b \cdot ROE \cdot  \text{BV}$}
\end{itemize}
\begin{align*}
        \text{Dividends} &= \text{Net Income} - \text{Retained Earnings} \\
        &= BV \cdot ROE - \Delta BV \\
        &= BV \cdot ROE - b \cdot ROE \cdot BV \\
        &= (1-b) \cdot ROE \cdot BV \\
        &= p \cdot ROE \cdot BV

\Green{\Eg What should be Firm ABC's stock price today} (last day of year 0)
\begin{itemize}
    \item Book value of \$37.80 (per share) at the end of year 0.
    \item Growth plan is to reinvest 80\% of its earnings next year.
    \item After that, it will focus on returning cash to shareholder beginning in year 2, paying out 60\% of its
        earnings as dividends.
    \item From year 3 onwards, ABC will pay out 80\% of earnings and plans to maintain this payout policy forever.
    \item Assume that the market is expecting an ROE of 10\% for years 1 and 2, and an ROE of 8\% from year 3 onwards,
    \item Assume a constant discount rate of 8\%.
